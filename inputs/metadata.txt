# METADATA: DATA SOURCES AND DETAILS

## 1. TURBINE DATA

Power curves for two reference wind turbines (NREL 5 MW and NREL 15 MW) are provided in CSV files. These files are used to compute the time series of power output and Annual Energy Production (AEP).

- **NREL 5 MW Reference Turbine**
  - Hub Height: 90 m
  - Source: https://github.com/NREL/turbine-models/blob/main/turbine_models/data/Offshore/NREL_Reference_5MW_126.csv

- **NREL 15 MW Reference Turbine**
  - Hub Height: 150 m
  - Source: https://github.com/NREL/turbine-models/blob/main/turbine_models/data/Offshore/2020ATB_NREL_Reference_15MW_240.csv

## 2. WIND DATA (REANALYSIS)

The wind data is sourced from the **ERA5 reanalysis dataset**. Reanalysis combines model data with observations using data assimilation to produce a globally complete and consistent dataset. ERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave, and land-surface quantities (More details on ERA5 can be found in ECMWF documentation).

### Data Files and Naming

- The wind data is provided in multiple **NetCDF4 files (.nc files)** in the `inputs` folder.
- **Naming Convention:** "XXXX-YYYY.nc", which indicates wind data from year XXXX to year YYYY.

### Available Variables (m/s)

The NetCDF4 files contain the following four data variables (all in metres per second [m/s]):

1.  **100m u-component of wind [m/s]:** Eastward component of the wind at 100 metres above the surface.
2.  **100m v-component of wind [m/s]:** Northward component of the wind at 100 metres above the surface.
3.  **10m u-component of wind [m/s]:** Eastward component of the wind at 10 metres above the surface.
4.  **10m v-component of wind [m/s]:** Northward component of the wind at 10 metres above the surface.
